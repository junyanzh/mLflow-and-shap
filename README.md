# MLflow + SHAP Integration: Enhancing Model Transparency and Management

Welcome to the repository dedicated to the integration of MLflow and SHAP. This solution emphasizes the importance of streamlined model operations, from training to interpretation, ensuring that modern AI models are not just efficient but also transparent.

Inside this repository, you'll find:

download data.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook that can be executed on Google Colab. It contains code for data acquisition, preprocessing, and initial exploration. Before diving into model training and interpretation, make sure to run this notebook to gather the necessary datasets.

MLflow and SHAP.ipynb: This notebook is tailored for Databricks. It delves deep into the intricacies of model training, versioning, interpretation, and deployment using MLflow integrated with SHAP for insightful model explanations.

By leveraging the power of both MLflow and SHAP, this repository aims to provide a comprehensive toolkit for data scientists and ML practitioners, addressing the increasing demand for model transparency in today's AI-driven world.

Feel free to clone, star, and contribute! Your feedback is invaluable to ensure the continual refinement and enhancement of these tools and practices.

I hope this serves your needs! Let me know if you'd like any further modifications.
